                    <div class="history-text">
                        <p>Rocket Jetstream Squirrel Palmer entered this world as all cats do.
                            Shortly after birth, he was given a name by his owners.
                            The name was "Mater".
                            This was because his purr was like a motor.</p>
                        <p>Around two months later, Rocky was brought to a new home as a birthday gift. The old owners were old friends with the new, and had given them two cats prior.
                            This time however, was special: It was a young cat-loving boy's 14th birthday, and my dear reader, that young boy... Was me.</p>
                        <p>Upon receiving this glorious gift, I quickly changed his name.
                            I wasn't all that fond of the name "Mater" as it comes from the Pixar movie "Cars".
                            I gave him a much better name: "Gorky".</p>
                        <p>Yes, you read that right. "Gorky".
                            Not the best of names I've picked, but in my defense, it came from one of the stuffed animals I loved playing with growing up.</p>
                        <p>Less than a week later, "Gorky" received yet another new name: "Rocky".
                            This one came from a show I and my siblings had been watching quite a bit of: "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends".</p>

                    <div class="history-text">
                        <p>As Rocky grew, his adventurous side began to shine.<br>
                            One day he was out exploring, and had a lovely time eating a small rodent.<br>
                            A short time later, he began vomiting blood: the rodent had eaten an anti-blood-clotting poison, and now Rocky had eaten it along with its small pointy bones.</p>
                        <p>After a thorough investigation by the vet, I was happy to hear that he would be alright.<br>
                            Despite this, I decided that from that day forward he would not be going outside unattended.<br>
                            After purchasing a cat-sized leash and harness, Rocky was again permitted outside.</p>
                        <p>He became anxious as he grew older, and spent more and more time sleeping in my room.<br>He is most likely in my room right now!</p>
