        Hello there! Welcome to my site!<br>
        If you are here, that can only mean one thing: You want to learn everything you can about my wonderful little furball named Rocky!<br>
        Where to beginâ€¦<br>
        As of at least September 19th 2023, Rocky is 12 years old. He is a plump little Russian Blue cat, and with that comes his beautiful grey fur and green eyes. Though his resting face is rather grumpy looking, he has a kind soul and kinder mannerisms.<br>
        My friends (correctly) find him to be very cute, and have even drawn artwork of him and I! He is a very anxious cat, and spends the vast majority of his time in my room snuggled up against me.<br>
        It is my hope that as you study the contents of this site, you will be able to understand even the smallest fragment of the love I have for the beautiful little flooffer named Rocky, and the sheer impact he has had on my life.<br>
        He is truly a blessing from He who made me.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Rocket Jetstream Squirrel Palmer entered this world as all cats do.<br>
        Shortly after birth, he was given a name by his owners.<br>
        The name was "Mater".<br>
        This was because his purr was like a motor.<br>
        Around two months later, Rocky was brought to a new home as a birthday gift. The old owners were old friends with the new, and had given them two cats prior.<br>
        This time however, was special: It was a young cat-loving boy's 14th birthday, and my dear reader, that young boy... Was me.<br>
        Upon receiving this glorious gift, I quickly changed his name.<br>
        I wasn't all that fond of the name "Mater" as it comes from the Pixar movie "Cars".<br>
        I gave him a much better name: "Gorky".<br>
        Yes, you read that right. "Gorky".<br>
        Not the best of names I've picked, but in my defense, it came from one of the stuffed animals I loved playing with growing up.<br>
        Less than a week later, "Gorky" received yet another new name: "Rocky".<br>
        This one came from a show I and my siblings had been watching quite a bit of: "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends".<br>
        As Rocky grew, his adventurous side began to shine.<br>
        One day he was out exploring, and had a lovely time eating a small rodent.<br>
        A short time later, he began vomiting blood: the rodent had eaten an anti-blood-clotting poison, and now Rocky had eaten it along with its small pointy bones.<br>
        After a thorough investigation by the vet, I was happy to hear that he would be alright.<br>
        Despite this, I decided that from that day forward he would not be going outside unattended.<br>
        After purchasing a cat-sized leash and harness, Rocky was again permitted outside.<br>
        He became anxious as he grew older, and spent more and more time sleeping in my room.<br>
        He is most likely in my room right now!

      </ul>
      <h3>Help</h3>
      <p>
        I can not express enough just how much Rocky has helped me throughout my life. He calmed me when I was anxious, he comforted me when I was distressed, and he yawned at me when it was getting late.<br>
        There have been times in my life when I was in very dark places, and had been seriously considering actions that would have ended poorly for me.<br>
        In those times, it was the thought of Rocky missing me that saved me.<br>
        I know with certainty that Rocky is a guardian angel to me, and I thank God for allowing me to care for my boy for over 12 years now, as they both continue to care for me.
