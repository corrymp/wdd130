    <p>Hello there!<br>
        This is an about me page.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in southern California, and still live there to this day.</p>
    <p>I sacrificed two years of my earthly state on a mission for God through the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br>
        I served in the San Diego Church Service Missionary Group. A few things I was tasked with include:<br>
        - General meetinghouse maintenance, such as cleaning up scratches in the woodwork, re-securing the pews to the ground, and changing lightbulbs,<br>
        - Serving in the local Family History Center and assisting the people there,<br>
        - and serving in the San Diego, California Temple in the Cafeteria and as an ordinance worker.</p>
    <p>After my Missionary service concluded, I continued to serve in the Temple for another year, and was then hired to work in the kitchen. About a month later, Covid-19 caused everything to close.<br>
        Despite being unable to do food work, the Church continued to pay me throughout the time leading up to the official, permanent closure of all Temple cafeterias.<br>
        I also served in the laundry for part of that time.</p>
    <p>I continued to serve as a Temple worker all the way to the extended closure for renovations, and am anxiously awaiting the day when I will return to worship and serve with God's children in His Holy house.</p>
